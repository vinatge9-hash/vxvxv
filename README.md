# Apex Gym Website

A three-page gym website built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive experience.

Files:
- index.html — Home/Landing page with hero, programs, plans, testimonials, and gallery.
- about.html — About page with story, team, and values.
- contact.html — Contact page with a simple inquiry form.
- README.md — this document.

How to view locally:
1. Save the four files in a folder.
2. Open index.html in your browser.
3. Navigate to About and Contact using the header links.

Notes on design and implementation:
- 100% Tailwind CSS classes (no separate CSS files).
- Backgrounds and visuals reflect the Gym category: crimson primary, black secondary, orange accent, and dark UI.
- Font pairing uses Oswald for headings and Roboto for body text.
- All images use descriptive alt text; hero uses a background image placeholder:

- Internal linking is set up between index.html, about.html, and contact.html.
- A simple mobile navigation toggle is included for small screens.

Best practices:
- Keep content realistic and category-appropriate.
- Ensure all interactive elements have accessible hover/focus states (Tailwind provides transition utilities).
- If you extend this site, replicate the navigation/footer across pages to maintain consistency.
